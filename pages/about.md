# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and Masters degree in Data Science. I am extremely passionate about artificial intelligence and I spend a lot of time working on cool projects involving **deep learning** and **reinforcement learning**. Visit my blog and projects page to check out my work, and maybe try them out yourself too!
